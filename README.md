# classify-sequences-of-raw-text
Using Google’s open-source TensorFlow machine learning tool to implement some deep learning architectures that will be used to classify sequences of raw text (this time, no pre-processing using dictionaries and words. We will be operating on raw characters!). Since deep learning is computationally expensive, it is strongly recommended that you use a GPU. The small learning problems we’ll consider will take about 10-20 minutes max using an inexpensive GPU but might take 10 times as long (or more) using a laptop. Plus, TensorFlow can be a bit of a pain to install on your laptop, so using Amazon is just plain easier. The only situation in which you might consider using your own hardware is if you’ve got a tricked out laptop/desktop with a beefy GPU for game playing that TensorFlow can make use of.

Note that after some thought, we decided to stick with TensorFlow’s older, “feed dict” based API, as well as lazy evaluation. For various reasons, this tends to be a bit lower-level and maybe harder to use, but it seems to be better with respect to exposing you to the full power of TensorFlow and how deep learning systems look to a programmer. Once you learn this stuff, it is easy to graduate to the newer API, or to use other tools such as Keras that make it even easier to program with TensorFlow.
